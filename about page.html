    <p>
        Growing up, I never imagined I would pursue a career in tech. My academic background is in Animal Science, and after graduating,
        I expected to follow a traditional path aligned with my studies. However, life had other plans. A chance encounter with a friend
        who worked as a data engineer sparked a new passion in me, and I began to explore the world of technology. This encounter opened 
        my eyes to the vast possibilities and opportunities that exist in the tech industry. I was fascinated by the logic behind 
        programming, how systems work, and the endless possibilities technology offers.

        As I delved deeper into the tech world, I realized that I had a lot to learn. I started by taking online courses and attending workshops
        to gain a better understanding of computer science and programming. My friend, who had initially introduced me to the world of tech, 
        recommended that I explore computer science, focusing on courses that would build a strong foundation. I took his advice and registered 
        for Harvard University's CS50 course, which provided me with a deep understanding of the basics of computer science.


        Through my journey, I have gained valuable experience in technical support and database management. I currently work in a technical 
        support role at a tech company, where I assist users in solving issues related to software and database systems. This role has been 
        instrumental in shaping my understanding of technology. I've learned how to troubleshoot complex systems, work with databases, and 
        communicate technical information to non-technical users. However, as much as I enjoy helping others, I know this is just the beginning 
        of my journey in tech.

    <h3 id="motivation">Why I Joined the School of Engineering Program</h3>
    <p>As I continued to learn more about the tech world, I became fascinated with cloud engineering. 
        I realized that cloud computing is the future, and companies of all sizes are transitioning to cloud-based infrastructure. 
        This transition offers scalability, flexibility, and efficiency, making it an exciting and rapidly evolving field. 
        To establish myself in the tech field and work on large-scale projects, I knew I needed to understand the cloud.

        AltSchool Africa's program in cloud engineering aligns perfectly with my career goals, offering in-depth training and hands-on 
        experience with cloud platforms and tools. I am excited about the opportunity to learn from experienced instructors and 
        to be part of a community of like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology.

        I am particularly drawn to AltSchool's project-based approach to learning, which will allow me to apply theoretical concepts
         to real-world problems. I am confident that this approach will help me develop the skills and expertise necessary to succeed 
         in the field of cloud engineering.

    <h3 id="goal">My Goals for the School of Engineering Program</h3>
    <p>My primary goal is to gain a deep understanding of cloud engineering and develop the skills necessary to architect,
         build, and manage cloud-based systems. I aim to use this knowledge to transition into roles involving cloud infrastructure
          design, application development, or cloud security.

        Through the program, I hope to gain hands-on experience with cloud platforms and tools, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS),
         Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. I am excited about the opportunity to work on projects that involve designing and deploying 
         cloud-based systems, and to learn from experienced instructors who have industry experience.
        
        In addition to gaining technical skills, I hope to expand my professional network through mentorship and networking 
        opportunities. I believe that networking is an essential part of career development, and I am excited about the opportunity
         to connect with other professionals in the field.
        
        Ultimately, my goal is to make a meaningful contribution to the field of cloud engineering and to be part of a community of
         professionals who are shaping the future of technology. I am confident that the School of Engineering program at AltSchool
          will provide me with the skills, knowledge, and expertise necessary to achieve my goals.
